STQL consist of two lexers that define the lexical rules. The first one, handles
the turtle files and the second, handles the queries in the languge. The lexer for
the turtle files recognizes the different parts of a turtle triple and creates
corresponding tokens that will be parsed lates. It recognizes the base, prefix,
URIs, integers, string and booleans (for the Objects) and the different special
symbols that are within the file. The lexer for the queries, creates tokens for 
the different key words and the special characters within the queries. Both lexers,
also allow for comments in the code (lines that start with --).
